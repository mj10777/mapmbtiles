ECW JPEG 2000 SDK COMMERCIAL USE LICENSE AGREEMENT

IMPORTANT-READ CAREFULLY: This ERM End-User License Agreement ("Agreement") is a legal agreement between you (either an individual or a legal entity) ("Licensee") and Earth Resource Mapping Limited ("ERM") for the ERM ECW JPEG 2000 SDK software product under this Commercial Use License Agreement, which includes computer software and may include "online" or electronic documentation, associated media, and printed materials, including the source code, example programs and the documentation ("Software Product").

By installing, copying, or otherwise using the Software Product, Licensee agrees to be bound by the terms of this Agreement. If Licensee does not agree to the terms of this Agreement, Licensee may not install, copy, or otherwise use the Software Product; Licensee may, however, return it to Licensee's place of purchase for a full refund. In addition, by installing, copying, or otherwise using any updates or other components of the Software Product that Licensee receives separately as part of the Software Product ("Updates"),

The intent of this license is to establish commercial rights to the use of the ECW JPEG 2000 SDK with Unlimited Decompressing and Unlimited Compressing.

Licensee agrees to be bound by any additional license terms that accompany such Updates. If Licensee does not agree to the additional license terms that accompany such Updates, Licensee may not install, copy, or otherwise use such Updates.

Upon Licensee's acceptance of the terms and conditions of this Agreement, ERM grants Licensee the right to use the Software Product in the manner provided below.

The Software Product is protected by patents, copyright laws and international copyright treaties, as well as other intellectual property laws and treaties. The Software Product is licensed, not sold. Rights to use patents, including ERM's large DWT and streaming imagery patents, are given only for use with the ECW JPEG 2000 SDK and not for other uses.

Granted Rights

1) GRANT OF LICENSE. This EULA grants you the following limited, non-exclusive rights, provided you agree to and comply with any and all conditions in this license. Installation of the Software, whole or partial distribution of the Software, or software items that link with the Software, in any form signifies acceptance of this license.

a) In return for a one-off License fee (see ERM's current price list), ERM grants to Licensee as an individual a personal, nonexclusive, non-transferable license to make and use copies of the Software Product for the sole purposes of designing, developing, and testing Licensee's software product(s) ("Applications").  Applications are defined as one or more of the following three (3) types: (1) "Server Software" that provides services or functionality on a computer acting as a server (and the computer running the Server Software shall be referred to as the "Server"); (2) "Client Software" that allows a computer, workstation, terminal, handheld PC, pager, telephone, "smart phone," or other electronic device (each of the foregoing a "Device") to access or utilize the services or functionality provided by Server Software or provide other functionality and; (3) "Software Development Kits" (SDK's) which are software product similar in intent to this software product.

b) Licensee may install copies of the Software Product on an unlimited number of computers provided that Licensee is the only individual using the Software Product. If Licensee is an entity, ERM grants Licensee the right to designate one, and only one, individual within Licensee's organization who shall have the sole right to use the Software Product in the manner provided above. Licensee may at any time, but not more frequently that once every six (6) months, designate another individual to replace the current designated user by notifying ERM, so long as there is no more than one designated user at any given time.

c) The Software Product may provide links to third party libraries or code (collectively "Third Party Libraries") to implement various functions.  Third Party Libraries are not prepared by or owned by ERM, and do not comprise part of the Software Product. In some cases, access to Third Party Libraries may be included along with the Software Product delivery as a convenience for development and testing only.  Licensee acknowledges (1) that some Third Party Libraries may require additional licensing of copyright and patents from the owners of such, and (2) that distribution of any of the Software Product referencing any portion of a Third Party Library may require appropriate licensing from such third parties and, in the event that such licensing is not granted, may result in the removal of such Third Party Library from the Software Product.

2) GENERAL TERMS THAT APPLY TO APPLICATIONS AND REDISTRIBUTABLES

ERM grants Licensee a nonexclusive right to reproduce and distribute the ECW JPEG 2000 Runtime  and Sample Code as contained in the "examples" directory ("Redistributables") for execution on any operating System. Copies of Redistributables may only be distributed with and for the sole purpose of executing Applications permitted under this Agreement that Licensee has created using the Software Product.

Under no circumstances may any copies of Redistributables be distributed separately.

The license granted in this Agreement for Licensee to create Applications and distribute them and the Redistributables (if any) to Licensee's customers is subject to all of the following conditions:

j) Licensee may not use ERM's or any of its suppliers' names, logos, or trademarks to market Application, except to state that Application was developed using the Software Product;

k) Where Redistributables are supplied to a third party as part of client software they must be statically linked to the NCSECWCU.LIB static link library in the "lib" Directory.
